# Fun-Chat
I have created my own chat using WebSocket connection protocol.

# To run the application follow these steps
- Use `node 14.x` or higher.
- Clone this repo: `$ git clone https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/fun-chat-server`.
- install the dependencies with `npm i`
- create the `.env` file and specify the [port settings](#Setting-the-Listening-Port-Parameters) and server [event log settings](#Server-Event-Display-Settings) in it
- start the local server using `npm run start` The server runs on port 4000 and listens for messages from client applications.
- Enjoy the chat [Here](https://regemler.github.io/Async-Race/)
